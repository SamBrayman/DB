A materialized view on shipdate would reduce access costs thereby decreasing running time.
Parallel processing would also speed up processing tuples.
alter table lineitem parallel 4;
create materialized view lineitem_shipdate enable query rewrite as select * from lineitem where l_shipdate <= DATE('1998-09-02');

A materialized view on order and customer keys would reduce access costs thereby decreasing running time.
Parallel processing would also speed up processing tuples.
alter table lineitem parallel 4;
alter table customer parallel 4;
alter table orders parallel 4;
create materialized view lineitem_orders enable query rewrite as select * from lineitem, orders where l_orderkey = o_orderkey;
create materialized view customer_orders enable query rewrite as select * from customer, orders where c_custkey = o_ocustkey;

We will use statistical analysis because there's a join on a lot of tables. Computing the best possible join is probably easier than maintaining
a materialized view on all of the tables.
Parallel processing would also speed up processing tuples.
alter table lineitem parallel 4;
alter table customer parallel 4;
alter table orders parallel 4;
alter table supplier parallel 4;
alter table nation parallel 4;
alter table region parallel 4;
analyze table lineitem compute statistics; 
analyze table customer compute statistics; 
analyze table orders compute statistics; 
analyze table supplier compute statistics; 
analyze table nation compute statistics; 
analyze table region compute statistics;

We will use parallel processing to speed up processing tuples.
A materialized view on shipdate would reduce access costs thereby decreasing running time.
alter table lineitem parallel 4;
create materialized view lineitem_shipdate enable query rewrite as select * from lineitem where l_shipdate >= DATE('1994-01-01');

We will use a materialized view on orderkey and customer key to reduce access costs thereby decreasing running time.
Parallel processing would also speed up processing tuples.

create materialized view customer_orders enable query rewrite as select * from customer, orders where c_custkey = o_ocustkey;
alter table lineitem parallel 4;
alter table customer parallel 4;
alter table orders parallel 4;

We will use a materialized view on customer key to reduce access costs thereby decreasing running time.
We will use parallel processing to speed up processing tuples.
