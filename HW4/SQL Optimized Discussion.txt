Part 1
Query 1
Looks great. Super quick. An index would probably speed up the query though. Index on shipdate.
Query 3
Query plan seems fine. Uses customer join on orders then join on lineitem to save time.
A materialized view on lineitem would save time. We use it in almost all the queries as well so it would be
worthwhile.
Query 5
A bottle neck is the join on lineitem. Maybe join all other tables first then do the join so that there
are fewer tuples to join.
Query 6
Looks great. Super quick. An index would probably speed up the query though.
Query 18
Maybe check the statistics for whether filtering lineitem is better than doing the join on customer or orders.
If the result of either join is smaller than the filtering should change plan.
Query 22
Accesses customer table twice. Can make a materialized view if this is necessary. Index on shipdate.

Part 2

Part 3

Materialized views would have been used, but since they weren't available they were omitted.
Parallelization can only help speed up processing tuples.
Statistics should only be used on joins with large numbers of relations since join optimization takes time.
The indexes didn't help very much likeyl due to the nature of the fields in the tables. If the fields
aren't unique the program will have to travel along the index until it finds the right tuple. If the fields are 
unique, but you need all of them, the index doesn't help very much.

A materialized view on shipdate would reduce access costs thereby decreasing running time.
Parallel processing would also speed up processing tuples.
alter table lineitem parallel 4;
create materialized view lineitem_shipdate enable query rewrite as select * from lineitem where l_shipdate <= DATE('1998-09-02');

A materialized view on order and customer keys would reduce access costs thereby decreasing running time.
Parallel processing would also speed up processing tuples.
alter table lineitem parallel 4;
alter table customer parallel 4;
alter table orders parallel 4;
create materialized view lineitem_orders enable query rewrite as select * from lineitem, orders where l_orderkey = o_orderkey;
create materialized view customer_orders enable query rewrite as select * from customer, orders where c_custkey = o_ocustkey;

We will use statistical analysis because there's a join on a lot of tables. Computing the best possible join is probably easier than maintaining
a materialized view on all of the tables.
Parallel processing would also speed up processing tuples.
alter table lineitem parallel 4;
alter table customer parallel 4;
alter table orders parallel 4;
alter table supplier parallel 4;
alter table nation parallel 4;
alter table region parallel 4;
analyze table lineitem compute statistics; 
analyze table customer compute statistics; 
analyze table orders compute statistics; 
analyze table supplier compute statistics; 
analyze table nation compute statistics; 
analyze table region compute statistics;

We will use parallel processing to speed up processing tuples.
A materialized view on shipdate would reduce access costs thereby decreasing running time.
alter table lineitem parallel 4;
create materialized view lineitem_shipdate enable query rewrite as select * from lineitem where l_shipdate >= DATE('1994-01-01');

We will use a materialized view on orderkey and customer key to reduce access costs thereby decreasing running time.
Parallel processing would also speed up processing tuples.
create materialized view lineitem_orders enable query rewrite as select * from lineitem, orders where l_orderkey = o_orderkey;
create materialized view customer_orders enable query rewrite as select * from customer, orders where c_custkey = o_ocustkey;
alter table lineitem parallel 4;
alter table customer parallel 4;
alter table orders parallel 4;

We will use a materialized view on customer key to reduce access costs thereby decreasing running time.
We will use parallel processing to speed up processing tuples.
create materialized view customer_orders enable query rewrite as select * from customer, orders where c_custkey = o_ocustkey;
alter table customer parallel 4;
alter table orders parallel 4;

Results
Query 1 optimized did marginally better than the normal query. This is likely due to random underlying speed decay
due to others on the system.
Query 3 optimized did better than the normal query. Parallelizing the tables likely sped up the processing time. The
optimized query used fewer steps than the normal query based on the query plans. This likely sped up the query.
Query 5 optimized did better than the normal query. Query 5 optimized used fewer steps than the normal query.
The redo size and number of recursive calls for the normal query were also larger. These factors, in particular,
the number of recursice calls likely slowed down the normal query.
Query 6 optimized did worse than the normal query. We had more recursive calls in the optimized query likely
slowing down the query. However, we did have fewer physical reads so if memory was a constraint, parallelization
would be desirable.
Query 18 optimized did worse than the normal query. The optimized query used parallelization. This likely caused
an increase of 270 in the redo size. It also opened up the system to being slowed down by others doing parallel
proessing. These factors likely caused the query to slow down. 
Query 22 did worse than the normal query. The normal query had fewer recursive calls likely speeding up 
the process. Paralellization did help with the number of physical reads though so if we were short on memory, 
parallelization would probably be better despite being slightly slower.

Parallelization helps in terms of the number of physical reads so if memory is a constraint this option should 
be considered. It does however slow down processes like aggregations.
Statistics were some of the best tools for speeding up queries in general. Taking into account the amount of time
it takes to create and maintain these statistics would however decrease their increase in speed, especially on large
relations like lineitem and orders.
