Design Choices:
We didn't do the index join. We believe that everything works. Everything pases the Doctests and Unit tests.
We ran the experiments on the smallest data set and tried to run them on the larger data sets, however,
our programs timed out on the larger data sets.
We have two graphs to visualise the experiment results. One shows the results for experiments that were fast. 
The other shows the results for experiments that were slow.
We have made an attempt at sort.
