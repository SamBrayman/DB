Design Choices:
Contiguous page uses the absolute offset as the index.  Therefore it rejects inserting a tuple if the index is not greater than the header size.

Slotted page inherits from Page and SlottedPageHeader inherits from PageHeader.
For slotted page we keep track of the amount of space added to the bit map per tuple added.  

All of the unit tests/doctests (page and slotted page) pass.
